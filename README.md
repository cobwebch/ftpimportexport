# FTP Import Export TYPO3 extension

This TYPO3 CMS extension manages imports or exports of files via FTP. One or more servers can be defined,
with synchronisation configuration for each of them.

A Scheduler task is used to run the imports or exports.

Define import or export configurations as records in the TYPO3 CMS backend.
Use the built-in help for guidelines on how to fill the fields.
